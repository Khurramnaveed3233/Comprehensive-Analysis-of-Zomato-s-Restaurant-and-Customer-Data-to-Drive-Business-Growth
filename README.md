The project addresses the following key business questions:

How We Solved the Business Questions

- **SQL Queries for Data Extraction :**
  
Used SQL queries to extract relevant data from tables such as Orders, UserOrders, RestaurantRevenue, Ratings, and CuisineOrders.
Applied advanced SQL techniques like Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Window Functions, and Aggregations to derive meaningful insights.

Statistical Analysis :
Calculated metrics such as total revenue, average order value, and delivery times using aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, etc.).
Ranked restaurants and dishes using ROW_NUMBER() and RANK() functions.

Data Visualization :
Created visualizations using tools like Tableau or Power BI to present trends and patterns in customer behavior, restaurant performance, and revenue distribution.
Used bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps to highlight key findings.

Segmentation and Categorization :
Segmented restaurants into "High Revenue," "Medium Revenue," and "Low Revenue" categories based on monthly sales.
Identified premium customers by analyzing spending patterns and frequency of orders.

Anomaly Detection :
Detected anomalies such as users placing multiple orders within the same minute from different locations using time-based filtering and grouping.

Indexing and Optimization :
Suggested indexing strategies for large datasets to improve query performance, ensuring scalability for millions of rows.
